# Metadata Randomization Implementation

## Overview

The Chafftafarian Chaff Generator now includes comprehensive metadata randomization functionality that ensures all generated files have realistic, randomized timestamps instead of revealing their actual creation time. This addresses the security concern where all files would otherwise show they were created during the same generation session.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. File System Metadata Randomization

**Location**: [`main.py:randomize_file_metadata()`](main.py:232)

- **Creation Time**: Randomized within realistic age ranges (1 day to 10 years old)
- **Modification Time**: Set between creation time and a later date
- **Access Time**: Either recent (within 90 days) or close to modification time

**Age Distribution by File Type**:
- **Emails (EML)**: 40% recent, 30% medium, 20% old, 10% archive
- **Documents (PDF/DOCX)**: 20% recent, 40% medium, 30% old, 10% archive  
- **Data Files (XLSX/CSV)**: 10% recent, 30% medium, 40% old, 20% archive
- **Images (JPG/PNG)**: 15% recent, 25% medium, 35% old, 25% archive

### 2. Document Content Date Randomization

**Location**: [`templates.py:BaseTemplate._setup_random_date_ranges()`](templates.py:60)

All embedded dates within document content are now randomized:

- **Business Letters**: Date headers use randomized document dates
- **Reports**: Report dates span realistic time ranges
- **Invoices**: Invoice and due dates are properly spaced
- **Memos**: Memo dates reflect document age
- **Emails**: Email headers show randomized send dates
- **CSV Data**: Registration dates, transaction dates, etc. are randomized
- **Configuration Files**: Generation timestamps are randomized

### 3. Cross-Platform Compatibility

The implementation handles different operating systems:

- **Unix/Linux**: Sets modification and access times via `os.utime()`
- **Windows**: Additionally attempts to set creation time via `win32file` (if available)
- **Fallback**: Gracefully handles missing Windows APIs

## Integration Points

### Main Execution Flow

The metadata randomization is integrated into the main execution flow in [`main.py:main()`](main.py:425):

```python
# Generate files
success_count, encoded_files = generate_chaff_files(settings, plans)

# CRITICAL: Randomize file metadata before cleanup or termination
randomize_file_metadata(settings, encoded_files)

# Cleanup if requested
if settings.delete_after_completion:
    cleanup_files(settings, encoded_files)
```

### Template System Enhancement

Each template class now:

1. **Initializes randomized date ranges** during construction
2. **Uses consistent document dates** throughout content generation
3. **Provides helper methods** for date randomization:
   - `get_random_document_date()` - Base document date
   - `get_random_date_in_range()` - Dates relative to document date

## Security Benefits

### Before Implementation
- All files showed creation time during generation session
- Document content contained current dates
- Easy to identify as artificially generated chaff
- Forensic analysis would reveal generation pattern

### After Implementation
- Files appear to have been created over months/years
- Document content dates match file system timestamps
- Realistic aging distribution mimics real document collections
- No forensic signature of batch generation

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite was implemented in [`test_metadata.py`](test_metadata.py):

- **Generates sample chaff files**
- **Verifies original timestamps** (should be current)
- **Applies metadata randomization**
- **Confirms timestamp changes** (should be historical)
- **Validates distribution** across time ranges

### Test Results
```
✅ SUCCESS: Metadata randomization is working!
Files with randomized timestamps: 9/9
```

## Usage

The metadata randomization is **automatically applied** during normal chaff generation:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Generate chaff with automatic metadata randomization
python main.py

# Test the functionality
python test_metadata.py
```

## Technical Details

### Time Range Categories

1. **Recent**: 1-30 days old
2. **Medium**: 30 days - 2 years old  
3. **Old**: 2-5 years old
4. **Archive**: 5-10 years old

### Timestamp Relationships

- **Creation ≤ Modification ≤ Access**
- **Realistic spacing** between timestamps
- **70% chance** of recent access time
- **Consistent document age** throughout content

### Error Handling

- **Graceful degradation** if timestamp setting fails
- **Cross-platform compatibility** with fallbacks
- **Detailed logging** of randomization results
- **Sample output** showing randomized timestamps

## Files Modified

1. **[`main.py`](main.py)** - Added `randomize_file_metadata()` function and integration
2. **[`templates.py`](templates.py)** - Enhanced all template classes with date randomization
3. **[`test_metadata.py`](test_metadata.py)** - Created comprehensive test suite

## Verification

The implementation can be verified by:

1. **Running the test suite**: `python test_metadata.py`
2. **Checking file timestamps**: Use `ls -la` or `stat` on generated files
3. **Examining document content**: Open generated files to verify embedded dates
4. **Forensic analysis**: No batch generation signature should be detectable

## PDF Corruption Fix

### Issue Identified
During testing, it was discovered that PDF files were being corrupted when encoded (base64, encrypted, etc.) because:

1. **Encoded PDFs retained `.pdf` extension** but contained encoded data (not actual PDF content)
2. **Applications couldn't open them** as they expected PDF format but found base64/encrypted data
3. **MIME type confusion** occurred when files had wrong extensions

### Solution Implemented
**Filename Extension Modification** ([`main.py:get_actual_filename()`](main.py:24)):

- **Encoded files get appropriate extensions**:
  - `document.pdf` + base64 → `document.pdf.b64`
  - `report.pdf` + encryption → `report.pdf.enc`
  - `data.xlsx` + zip → `data.xlsx.zip`

- **Unencoded files keep original extensions** and remain fully functional
- **Clear indication** of encoding method prevents confusion

### Decoder Utility
Created [`decode_chaff.py`](decode_chaff.py) utility to decode files when needed:

```bash
# Decode base64 encoded file
python decode_chaff.py document.pdf.b64

# Decode encrypted file with password
python decode_chaff.py report.pdf.enc -p "password123"

# Extract ZIP file
python decode_chaff.py data.xlsx.zip -p "zippassword"
```

## Conclusion

The metadata randomization implementation successfully addresses the security requirement by ensuring that all chaff files appear to have been created and modified over realistic time periods, eliminating the forensic signature of batch generation and making the chaff indistinguishable from legitimate document collections.

**Additionally, the PDF corruption issue has been resolved** by implementing proper filename extensions for encoded files, ensuring that:
- Encoded files are clearly identified and don't cause application errors
- Unencoded files remain fully functional in their native formats
- Users can decode files when needed using the provided utility
